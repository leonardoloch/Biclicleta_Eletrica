This project was intended for a control system for an electric bike. Its operation was based on a device that initially had the possibility of indicating the desired speed, such as an autopilot and so on through a bike motor to reach that speed. There was a possibility of braking and the system would identify the case and not force the speed initially indicated. For the construction of the system we used the PIC16F877A microcontroller, two electric motors. For testing we used Proteus software and a test bench.
